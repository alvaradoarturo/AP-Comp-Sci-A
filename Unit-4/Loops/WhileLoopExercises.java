/*
  (Easy)Countdown Timer:
  Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and counts down 
  from that number to 1, printing each number along the way. Print a 
  surprise message at the end.

  (Medium) Exercise 1: Factorial
  Create a program that calculates the factorial of a positive integer 
  input by the user. Use a while loop to calculate the factorial.


  (Hard)Exercise 2: FizzBuzz 
  Implement the FizzBuzz problem using a while loop. Print numbers from 1 
  to 100, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with 
  "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

  (RIP) Pattern Printing:
  Write a program that prints the following pattern using a while loop(s):
  " 
  " " 
  " " " 
  " " " " 
  " " " " " 
  " " " " " " 
  " " " " " " "
